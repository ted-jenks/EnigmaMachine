# Enigma Machine

This repo contains the code used in a university project to create an enigma machine in c++. It uses OOP concepts in C++.

The executable must be started with the configuration files for the plugboard, reflector and rotors of the machine (example files given here).

The machine can take a string of characters and encode/decode them. Passing an encoded string to a machine with the same setup as the message was encoded with will decode it.
